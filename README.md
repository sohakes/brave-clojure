# brave-clojure
Brave clojure (http://www.braveclojure.com/) exercises.

I'm publishing it so I feel obligated to finish the book, but it probably doesn't have anything useful.

If you find this repository for some reason, and you can think of a better way to solve any problem, I'm happy to hear it.

I also added an updated .emacs.d, because the one that I downloaded from the website didn't work well, there is a problem with the ido-ubiquitous package. I just updated the packages and fixed another file that started to have a problem.
